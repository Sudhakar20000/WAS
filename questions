1.what is websphere ?
WebSphere Application Server (WAS) is a Java application server developed by IBM. It is a software framework and middleware
that provides an environment for building, deploying,and managing Java-based enterprise applications. WAS is a popular choice
for enterprise applications because it is a mature and scalable platform that offers a wide range of features

2.what is cell in websphere?
a cell is a logical grouping of nodes that enables common administrative activities in a distributed environment.
A cell is managed by a Deployment Manager, which is a process that provides a centralized view and control for all elements in the cell. 

3.what is deployment manager in websphere?
a deployment manager is a process that provides a single, central point of administrative control for all of the elements in a 
distributed cell.The deployment manager communicates with the application servers using a variety of protocols, including SOAP,
HTTP, and IIOP.

4.what is node in websphere?
a node is a logical grouping of one or more application servers on a physical or virtual machine. Nodes are the basic building blocks
of a WebSphere cell,and they are used to group application servers together for administrative purposes.
>Starting and stopping application servers
>Monitoring the health of application servers
>Collecting and reporting statistics about application servers
>Managing the configuration of application servers

5.what is managed node and unmanaged node in websphere?
Managed nodes: are controlled by a deployment manager, which is a centralized process that manages the configuration and operation of
all nodes in a cell.Managed nodes are typically used in production environments where high availability and scalability are required.
Stored in the deployment manager's configuration repository ,Monitored by the deployment manage ,Can be configured for high availability
Unmanaged nodes: are not controlled by a deployment manager. They are typically used in development environments or for standalone
applications.Unmanaged nodes can be configured using the command line or the WebSphere administration console and used in development mode.
Not controlled by a deployment manager, configuration Stored on the node itself, Stored on the node itself

6.what is standalone application in websphere application server?
a standalone application is an application that is deployed to a single application server instance. This means that the application 
is not clustered, and it does not run on multiple servers. Standalone applications are typically used for small or simple applications 
that do not require high availability or scalability.

7.what is node agent in websphere?
A node agent in WebSphere Application Server is a software process that runs on each node in a cell and communicates with the deployment 
manager to manage the application servers on that node.Node agents are responsible for the following tasks: Monitoring the health of
application servers ,Starting and stopping application servers ,Managing the configuration of application servers

8.Differentiate between the node agent, node, and node group.?
Node - node is basically the grouping of the processing of the server. This grouping is done logically and is well maintained by the
Websphere tool.It also helps in controlling the operations and data configuration.  
Node agent - each node consists of an agent that works side by side with the deployment manager and hence the administration process is
managed by it.In short, the node agent acts as the mediator if both the deployment manager and notes.  
Node group - This refers to the grouping of various nodes and has the same capability as that of nodes.  

9.what is Dynamic cache?
A dynamic cache is a type of cache that automatically updates its contents based on changes to the underlying data. This means that
the cache is always up-to-date and does not need to be manually refreshed. Dynamic caches are often used in web applications to improve
performance by reducing the number of times that data needs to be retrieved from the database.Dynamic caches work by storing a copy of
frequently accessed data in memory. When a request is made for data that is already in the cache, the cached copy is returned to the user.
This eliminates the need to retrieve the data from the database, which can be a time-consuming process.

10.How does symmetrical and asymmetrical clustering work in the WebSphere? 
Symmetrical clustering:is a deployment architecture where all servers in a cluster perform the same operations, including running 
application logic and providing administrative services.This means that there is no separation of concerns between the runtime servers
and the administration servers. 
Asymmetrical clustering: is a deployment architecture where application servers are called runtime servers and are used to run application 
logic. Administrative servers are used to provide administrative services, such as starting and stopping runtime servers, managing user 
accounts, and monitoring the health and performance of runtime servers

11.What is the meaning of node sync?  
The WebSphere application server or also known as the WAS provided by IBM is considered to be able to store all Thebes data and information
regarding the configuration process. It stores them in the repository provided by nodes which are known as the Master Repository. In order 
for the entire configuration to be stored or simply send to the server of the respective nodes while using the DMGR process, the nodes must
be synced properly. It is basically communication between the master repository and the local repository and can be done only in one way. 

12.What is the meaning of the word 'trace' in WebSphere?  
the term "trace" refers to a diagnostic logging mechanism that records detailed information about the execution of applications and 
components. It provides a granular view of the internal workings of the system, enabling developers and support personnel to identify and
troubleshoot issues.
NOTE: regular logs that capture only significant events, trace logs provide a more comprehensive and low-level perspective of the system's
behavior. This includes details about method calls, parameter values,data flow.

13.Define Ripple start?
ripple start is a technique for restarting a cluster of servers in a controlled and sequenced manner. It involves stopping and starting each
server in the cluster one at a time, ensuring that there is minimal disruption to application availability. Ripple starts are commonly used
when making configuration changes that affect all servers in a cluster, such as updating JVM settings or applying patches.
NOTE:Ripple starts are a valuable feature of WebSphere that can help administrators minimize downtime and maintain application availability
during configuration changes and maintenance operations. for example, if in a cluster a total of 5 JVMs are present and if Ripple Start is
used, it will first close the first JVM and then again restart it. In this way, it will be consecutively closing and restarting one JVM
after another.  

14.Define virtual host?
A virtual host is a logical grouping of resources on a single server that provides the appearance of multiple servers to clients. It allows
you to run multiple websites or applications on a single server, each with its own hostname, port number, and security settings. Virtual 
hosts are often used to isolate applications from each other, improve performance, and simplify administration.
NOTE: The application must be included in an URL and this is known as the virtual host.

15.what is registry in WAS?
The registry in WebSphere Application Server (WAS) is a centralized database that stores configuration information for the server, applications,
and components.It provides a centralized, secure, and consistent way to store configuration information, ensuring that WAS runs smoothly and
efficiently.

16.For gaining information on users, when does WAS get in touch with the registry?  
 WAS frequently accesses the registry to retrieve user information for various security-related tasks, including authentication,
authorization, access control, user profile management, security audits, and integration with external directory services. The registry
serves as a central repository for user data and permissions, enabling WAS to enforce security policies and protect sensitive resources

17.what is repository file in websphere?
 repository file is a file that contains the installation instructions and metadata for a particular WebSphere product or offering. 
It is essentially a package that encapsulates the software components, configuration settings, and documentation required to install
and manage a specific WebSphere component. 
Repository files play a crucial role in the installation and management of WebSphere environments. They provide a standardized and 
organized way to distribute and install WebSphere components, simplifying the deployment and maintenance of complex WebSphere systems.
