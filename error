1) You get page 403
when you are not authorized to access the page . It is a security error

2) You get page 404 error when the resources are not available.
Example If your web servers are down 404- means file not found here generate and propagate plugin-cfg.xml file once

3) You get Page 500 error when your JVM is down
500- means internal server error (code error in .er file or connection error) mostlly you find this in webserver logs (access logs or error logs) or in jvm logs or http-plugin.
NOTE:
403 an 404 is http error.Means Webserver error.U should find the error in error.log and access.log file of the http server logs.500 error is the internal server error
.It is the Websphere application server error.When the application is down,the application page is not displayed (network issue,configuration issue,application 
mapping issue,port issue,thread hung issue,app to DB connection issue etc.).U can find the error from SystemOut.log,SystemErr.log in Websphere Application server.

3.I am not able to open the Administrative console of websphere application server v8.5. The logs report Java Heap Space and Out of Memory errors.
I have searched online and the suggestions are to increase the JVM heap size. But how should I accomplish that now, when even the admin console is not working for me ?
In this situation you must bypass the administration console. If you want to do that just edit the configuration file for the server, i.e. edit the server.xml for that
particular server, either the application server process or the deployment manager process depending on what process suffers from the memory problem.
edit the following attributes:
jvmEntries debugArgs="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=7777" debugMode="false" disableJIT="false" genericJvmArguments="-Xquickstart"
runHProf="false" verboseModeClass="false" **initialHeapSize**="512" **maximumHeapSize**="1024" verboseModeGarbageCollection="false" verboseModeJNI="false" xmi:id=
"JavaVirtualMachine_1183121908656"
and restart server
