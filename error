1) You get page 403
when you are not authorized to access the page . It is a security error

2) You get page 404 error when the resources are not available.
Example If your web servers are down 404- means file not found here generate and propagate plugin-cfg.xml file once

3) You get Page 500 error when your JVM is down
500- means internal server error (code error in .er file or connection error) mostlly you find this in webserver logs (access logs or error logs) or in jvm logs or http-plugin.
NOTE:
403 an 404 is http error.Means Webserver error.U should find the error in error.log and access.log file of the http server logs.500 error is the internal server error
.It is the Websphere application server error.When the application is down,the application page is not displayed (network issue,configuration issue,application 
mapping issue,port issue,thread hung issue,app to DB connection issue etc.).U can find the error from SystemOut.log,SystemErr.log in Websphere Application server.

3.I am not able to open the Administrative console of websphere application server v8.5. The logs report Java Heap Space and Out of Memory errors.
I have searched online and the suggestions are to increase the JVM heap size. But how should I accomplish that now, when even the admin console is not working for me ?
In this situation you must bypass the administration console. If you want to do that just edit the configuration file for the server, i.e. edit the server.xml for that
particular server, either the application server process or the deployment manager process depending on what process suffers from the memory problem.
edit the following attributes:
jvmEntries debugArgs="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=7777" debugMode="false" disableJIT="false" genericJvmArguments="-Xquickstart"
runHProf="false" verboseModeClass="false" **initialHeapSize**="512" **maximumHeapSize**="1024" verboseModeGarbageCollection="false" verboseModeJNI="false" xmi:id=
"JavaVirtualMachine_1183121908656"
and restart server

4.how do we know a node is synchronous or not in websphere
To know if a node is synchronized, in the WebSphere admin console, select System administration > Nodes. In this example, AppSrv01Node01 is out of sync. In this example,
the node is synchronized. Be aware that if the dmgr cannot communicate with the node, a question mark icon will be displayed.

5.What is the difference between synchronization and full synchronization in websphere
With a full synchronization, all file will be synchronized. A full synchronization takes more time than a partial synchronization. In the WebSphere admin console,
expand System administration.

6.why we are synchronise in websphere application server.
A node contains one or more WebSphere application servers. When a managed nodes is federated into the dmgr, the node needs to be synchronized with the master configuration
so that the node is using the dmgr configuration.

7.what is propagate plug-in in websphere
you are sending the plugin-cfg. xml file from your WebSphere application server or dmgr to your IHS web server. 
The web server plugin is used to create a communication channel between IBMs IHS web server and a WebSphere application server
